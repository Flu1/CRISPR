Code used to identify successful CRISPR clones for Staller et al. 2019.

Running this code in R should allow you to identify potential clones which have successfully had genes knocked out by CRISPR.
The files provided in this repository show a single knockout clone.
The full sequencing files are available from the ENA and the barcodes used can be found in the attached spreadsheet.
